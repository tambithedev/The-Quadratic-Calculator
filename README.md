# The-Quadratic-Calculator
_Our quadratic calculator project for Jia's Brainrot Hackathon._

Thanks for checking out our project! To try it out for yourself, just download all of the files in the ```Source Code``` folder (you'll probably want to inspect them first) and run any of the html files. ```index.html``` is the Home page, so that's a good starting point.

The three other folders are up for documentation purposes and contain the files we worked on from the start. You can check those out too if you want to.

We hope you have fun!
